What is produced in an economy? How is it produced? Who gets the product? Microeconomics seeks to answer these fundamental questions about markets.

In this course, we’ll introduce you to microeconomic theory, together with some empirical results and policy implications. You’ll analyze mathematical models that describe the real-world behavior of consumers and firms, and you’ll see how prices make the world go ‘round.

You’ll join the ranks of business executives, policymakers, entrepreneurs, and global leaders who rely on the insights they derive from a working knowledge of microeconomics. Nobel memorial prize-winner Paul Samuelson invented the modern microeconomics curriculum at MIT. Now is your chance to learn the field from the intellectual tradition he began.

Topics include:

Consumer theory
	Supply and demand
	Market equilibrium
	Producer theory
	Monopoly
	Oligopoly
	Capital markets
	Welfare economics
	Public goods
	Externalities

                    <title>Molecular Biology - Part 1: DNA Replication and Repair</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/molecular-biology-part-1-dna-replication-mitx-7-28-1x-1</link>
                    <description>You’re acquainted with your DNA, but did you know that your cells synthesize enough DNA during your lifetime to stretch a lightyear in length? How does the cellular machinery accomplish such a feat without making more mistakes than you can survive? Why isn’t the incidence of cancer even higher than it is? And, if the DNA in each and every cell is two meters long, how is this genetic material compacted to fit inside the cell nucleus without becoming a tangled mess?

Are you ready to go beyond the “what" of scientific information presented in textbooks and explore how scientists deduce the details of these molecular models?

Take a behind-the-scenes look at modern molecular genetics, from the classic experimental events that identified the proteins involved in DNA replication and repair to cutting-edge assays that apply the power of genome sequencing. Do you feel confident in your ability to design molecular biology experiments and interpret data from them? We've designed the problems in this course to build your experimental design and data analysis skills.

Let’s explore the limits of our current knowledge about the replication machinery and pathways that protect the fidelity of DNA synthesis. If you are up for the challenge, join us in 7.28x Part 1: DNA Replication and Repair.

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/just-money-banking-if-society-mattered-mitx-11-405x-1</link>
                    <description>What do you know about banking? Do you know what your bank does with your money? The 2007/08 financial crisis highlighted some of the most fundamental issues with the mainstream banking system.

This course looks into banks that operate differently, namely, “just banks" that use capital and finance as a tool to address social and ecological challenges.

This course is for anyone who wants to understand the unique role banks play as intermediaries in our economy and how they can leverage that position to produce positive social, environmental, and economic change.

The instructors of this course have worked for over 10 years with just banks from around the world, as well as in the fields of community development, economic democracy, and social change.

No previous knowledge of finance or banking is needed to take this course.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/quantitative-biology-workshop-mitx-7-qbwx-3</link>
                    <description>Do you have an interest in biology and quantitative tools? Do you know computational methods but do not realize how they apply to biological problems? Do you know biology but do not understand how scientists really analyze complicated data? 7.QBWx: Quantitative Biology Workshop is designed to give learners exposure to the application of quantitative tools to analyze biological data at an introductory level. For the last few years, the Biology Department of MIT has run this workshop-style course as part of a one-week outreach program for students from other universities. With 7.QBWx, we can give more learners from around the world the chance to discover quantitative biology. We hope that this series of workshops encourages learners to explore new interests and take more biology and computational courses.
We expect that learners from 7.00x Introduction to Biology – The Secret of Life or an equivalent course can complete this workshop-based course without a background in programming. The course content will introduce programming languages but will not teach any one language in a comprehensive manner. The content of each week varies. We want learners to have an introduction to multiple languages and tools to find a topic that they would want to explore more. Participants with programming experience will find some weeks easier than students with only biology experience, while those with a biology background should find the week on genetics easier. We recommend that learners try to complete each week to find what interests them the most.

Residential Outreach Workshop Organizer and Creator

Mandana Sassanfar, Ph.D.

This workshop includes activities on the following biological topics: population biology, biochemical equilibrium and kinetics, molecular modeling of enzymes, visual neuroscience, genetics, gene expression and development, and genomics. The tools and programming languages include MATLAB, PyMOL, StarGenetics, Python, and R. This course does not require learners to download MATLAB. All MATLAB activities run and are graded within the edX platform. We do recommend that participants download a few other free tools for the activities so that they learn how to use the same tools and programs that scientists use.</description>

                    <title>Making Biologic Medicines for Patients: The Principles of Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/making-biologic-medicines-patients-mitx-10-03x-1</link>
                    <description>Learn how protein therapeutics are manufactured and explore the fundamental principles of biopharmaceutical manufacturing.

Humans have leveraged the power of cells for millennia to produce staples such as bread, cheese, beer and wine. Yet only recently have we begun to utilize cells as factories for the production of protein therapeutics.

These biologic drugs are able to treat otherwise untreatable diseases. In this course, you will learn how these life saving medicines are made.

We will connect the engineering fundamentals to real-world application by showing real pieces of biomanufacturing equipment in action and listening to experts describe real-world engineering challenges.</description>

                    <title>Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11</link>
                    <description>This course is the first of a two-course sequence: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python, and Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science. Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. Some of the people taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many it will be their first and last computer science courses. This run features updated lecture videos, lecture exercises, and problem sets to use the new version of Python 3.5. Even if you took the course with Python 2.7, you will be able to easily transition to Python 3.5 in future courses, or enroll now to refresh your learning.

Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are not "computation appreciation" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will.</description>

                    <description>This course from MIT’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering introduces the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, solid state physics, and electricity and magnetism. We use these principles to describe the origins of the electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of materials, and we discuss how these properties can be engineered to suit particular applications, including diodes, optical fibers, LEDs, and solar cells.
In this course, you will find out how the speed of sound is connected to the electronic band gap, what the difference is between a metal and a semiconductor, and how many magnetic domains fit in a nanoparticle. You will explore a wide range of topics in the domains of materials engineering, quantum mechanics, solid state physics that are essential for any engineer or scientist who wants to gain a fuller understanding of the principles underlying modern electronics.</description>

Join Professor Eric Lander and the MITx Biology team in this unique introductory biology learning experience. All 7.00x course materials are available here for exploration and completion, including video and interactive problem sets and exams for skill building. We strongly encourage you to work through the activities, towards a goal of learning biology. We have optimized the course settings for learning: instant feedback after trying problems and all content available at all times. We offer a rigorous means of certifying edX learners in their mastery of the MITx introductory biology content, through the MITx 7.00x Introduction to Biology Competency Exam. This exciting option is available ONLY to those who register for the verified-certificate track, and successful completion of this exam is the only assessment that counts toward a certificate. We highly recommend preparing for the Competency Exam certification by using the current course materials and MIT OpenCourseWare problems. The next Competency Exam will be open February 20, 2018 to February 27, 2018.
7.00x is an introductory level biology course hosted by professor Eric Lander, who was one of the leaders of the Human Genome Project. The course content reflects the topics taught in the MIT introductory biology courses and many biology courses across the world. As a learner, you will first focus on the structure and function of macromolecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins. You will discover how changes in the structure of some of these macromolecules alter their functions and what the implications of such changes have on human health. As you continue in the course, you will apply an understanding of heredity and information flow within cells to human health and disease and will learn about molecular biological techniques and their potential to impact our changing world. After you complete this course, you will have a foundation in biology that will allow you to understand the remarkable medical revolution going on today.
MITx 7.00x: Introduction to Biology – The Secret of Life will let you explore the mysteries of biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, recombinant DNA technology and genomics, and rational medicine. We are excited to take this journey with you!</description>

A randomized evaluation, also known as a randomized controlled trial (RCT), field experiment or field trial, is a type of impact evaluation that uses random assignment to allocate resources, run programs, or apply policies as part of the study design.

This course will provide step-by-step training on how to design and conduct an RCT. You will learn about why and when to conduct RCTs and the key components of a well-designed RCT.
In addition, this course will provide insights on how to implement your RCT in the field, including questionnaire design, piloting, quality control, data collection and management. The course will also go over common practices to ensure research transparency.
No previous economics or statistics background is required. However, economic and statistics concepts and vocabulary will be used and some familiarity is advised.</description>

This is a course for those who are interested in the challenge posed by massive and persistent world poverty, and are hopeful that economists might have something useful to say about this challenge. The questions we will take up include: Is extreme poverty a thing of the past? What is economic life like when living under a dollar per day? Are the poor always hungry? How do we make schools work for poor citizens? How do we deal with the disease burden? Is microfinance invaluable or overrated? Without property rights, is life destined to be "nasty, brutish and short"? Should we leave economic development to the market? Should we leave economic development to non-governmental organizations (NGOs)? Does foreign aid help or hinder? Where is the best place to intervene? And many others.

At the end of this course, you should have a good sense of the key questions asked by scholars interested in poverty today, and hopefully a few answers as well.</description>

In this course, we will study the different facets of human development in topics such as education, health, gender, the family, land relations, risk, informal and formal norms, public policy, and institutions. While studying each of these topics, we will delve into the following questions:

What determines the decisions of poor households in developing countries?
	What constraints are poor households subject to?
	What is the scope for policy interventions (implemented by the government, international organizations, or NGOs)?
	What policies have been tried out? Have they been successful?
At the same time, you will discover modern empirical methods in economics, in particular Randomized Control Trials (RCTs). Throughout the course, we will expose you to all facets of empirical projects, from experimental design and ethical issues, to data collection and data analysis.You will have the chance to gain experience working with real data using software for statistical analysis during weekly assignments.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/supply-chain-comprehensive-exam-virtual-mitx-ctl-cfx</link>
                    <description>The MITx MicroMasters credential in Supply Chain Management is a standalone certification program offered by MITx that is designed and administered by the MIT Center for Transportation &amp; Logistics (CTL); supported by the MIT Office of Digital Learning (ODL); and delivered on edx.org. The MITx MicroMasters credential consists of five intensive on-line courses covering all aspects of logistics and supply chain management along with a proctored comprehensive final exam (CFx). To take the CFx, you must pass all five courses of the MicroMasters program in Supply Chain Management as a verified student.
The CFx consists of two 120-minute exams, Exam I and Exam II. The exam must be broken into two exams for proctoring logistics. The exams will be a mix of qualitative and quantitative questions with the first exam covering more of the fundamentals of supply chain management and the second covering advanced and special topics. Students who have selected virtual proctoring will have from February 2nd 1500 UTC to February 5th 1500 UTC to take the exam. Once a student begins Exam I, they must complete both exams within 12 hours. Students cannot start Exam II without completing Exam I. Virtual test takers will use the Software Secure proctoring software to be virtually proctored.
If you are planning to take this exam in-person at an MIT SCALE center, per course team communications, please DO NOT enroll through this course instance. You will be pre-enrolled in the correct in-person proctored CFx and will be notified of course enrollment through the edX platform. Please watch for communications through the MITx MicroMasters portal.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/supply-chain-technology-systems-mitx-ctl-sc4x-2</link>
                    <description>There are underlying fundamental principles and concepts that apply to all supply chains, which can be expressed in relatively straightforward models. However, to actually implement them across a real supply chain requires the use of technology across multiple systems. Supply chains have a long history of using technology to improve efficiency and effectiveness. The shear scale and scope of most supply chains require many distinct systems to interact with each other.
Unfortunately, technology is a moving target. It is constantly evolving and improving so that today’s technology is outdated within a few years or months. Rather than focusing on a specific software system, this business and management course will focus on three aspects: fundamental concepts, core systems, and data analysis.
We will start with the introduction of fundamental concepts that are used in all software tools. We will cover IT fundamentals, including project management and software processes, data modeling, UML, relational databases and SQL. We will also introduce Internet technologies, such as XML, web services, and service-oriented architectures. No prior programming experience required.
We will then provide an overview of the main types of supply chain software including ERP, WMS, and TMS systems. We will describe their main functionality, how they work, how they are used, their architecture, data flows, and how they are organized into modules. We will also cover the software selection process and how software upgrade and implementation projects should be organized and managed.
Finally, we will dive into data analysis that is core to all large supply chains. We will introduce visualization and big data analysis techniques that are used in practice today.

                    <description>Differential equations are the language of the models we use to describe the world around us. Most phenomena require not a single differential equation, but a system of coupled differential equations. In this course, we will develop the mathematical toolset needed to understand 2x2 systems of first order linear and nonlinear differential equations. We will use 2x2 systems and matrices to model:

predator-prey populations in an ecosystem,
	competition for tourism between two states,
	the temperature profile of a soft boiling egg,
	automobile suspensions for a smooth ride,
	pendulums, and
	RLC circuits that tune to specific frequencies.

                    <description>This Supply Chain Fundamentals course is part of the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management, offered by #1 ranked SCM Master's program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Supply chains are complex systems involving multiple businesses and organizations with different goals and objectives. Many different analytical methods and techniques are used by researchers and practitioners alike to better design and manage their supply chains. This business and management course introduces the primary methods and tools that you will encounter in your study and practice of supply chains. We focus on the application of these methods, not necessarily the theoretical underpinnings.
We will begin with an overview of introductory probability and decision analysis to ensure that students understand how uncertainty can be modeled. Next, we will move into basic statistics and regression. Finally, we will introduce optimization modeling from unconstrained to linear, non-linear, and mixed integer linear programming.
This is a hands-on course. Students will use spreadsheets extensively to apply these techniques and approaches in case studies drawn from actual supply chains.

                    <description>There are underlying fundamental principles and concepts that apply to all supply chains, which can be expressed in relatively straightforward models. However, to actually implement them across a real supply chain requires the use of technology across multiple systems. Supply chains have a long history of using technology to improve efficiency and effectiveness. The shear scale and scope of most supply chains require many distinct systems to interact with each other.
Unfortunately, technology is a moving target. It is constantly evolving and improving so that today’s technology is outdated within a few years or months. Rather than focusing on a specific software system, this business and management course will focus on three aspects: fundamental concepts, core systems, and data analysis.
We will start with the introduction of fundamental concepts that are used in all software tools. We will cover IT fundamentals, including project management and software processes, data modeling, UML, relational databases and SQL. We will also introduce Internet technologies, such as XML, web services, and service-oriented architectures. No prior programming experience required.
We will then provide an overview of the main types of supply chain software including ERP, WMS, and TMS systems. We will describe their main functionality, how they work, how they are used, their architecture, data flows, and how they are organized into modules. We will also cover the software selection process and how software upgrade and implementation projects should be organized and managed.
Finally, we will dive into data analysis that is core to all large supply chains. We will introduce visualization and big data analysis techniques that are used in practice today.

                    <description>This Supply Chain Design course is part of the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management, offered by #1 ranked SCM Master's program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
CTL.SC2x Supply Chain Design covers all aspects involved in the design of supply chains for companies and organizations anywhere in the world. The course is divided into four main topic areas: Physical flow design, Supply chain finance, Information flow design, and Organization/Process design. In the design of physical flows, we show how to formulate and solve Transportation, Transshipment, Facility Location, and Network Design Problems. For financial flows we show how to translate supply chain concepts and actions into the language of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of a company. We cover Activity Based Costing, Working Capital, the Cash-to-Cash cycle and Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. The design of the information flow section describes how firms communicate with suppliers (procurement, risk contracts), internal resources (production planning, bills of materials, material requirements planning), and customers (Sales &amp; Operations Planning and other collaboration based processes). In the last section, we introduce performance metric design and organizational design within the supply chain organization focusing mainly on the centralize/decentralize decision.
The main topic areas we will focus on in this course are:
 

Supply Chain Network Design
	Supply Chain Finance
	Supplier Management

                    <description>Supply Chains are complex systems involving multiple firms and organizations with different goals and objectives. Additionally, there are external forces and trends that can impact (positively or negatively) a supply chain’s efficiency and effectiveness. Understanding the dynamics and risks within supply chains, both large and small, is key to being a successful supply chain professional.

This course builds on the fundamental models introduced in SC1x and the design trade-offs covered in SC2x. It is essentially a capstone in understanding how to successfully model, design, and manage a supply chain in any industry. We will divide the course into three sections.

First, we will introduce the field of System Dynamics. Developed at MIT, system dynamics is an approach that examines and models complex systems that feature interacting, non-linear, and dynamic elements. The objective is to better understand the underlying features of a complex system and to recommend policies and other actions to improve overall performance.

Second, we will explore the concepts of supply chain risk. Supply chains are subject to a wide number of potential disruptions – from both within and outside of the supply chain. Students will understand how supply chains can be better designed and managed to not only mitigate the downside of supply chain disruption but also to leverage and capture any upside.

Finally, the students will engage in a series of more extended case studies and simulations that demonstrate these complex relationships. Actual case studies and examples from companies will be used to help students better prepare for actual situations.

                    <description>This Supply Chain Fundamentals course is part of the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management, offered by #1 ranked SCM Master's program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The CTL.SC1x Supply Chain Fundamentals course provides the foundational skills for supply chain management and logistics. You will learn how to develop and apply analytic tools, approaches, and techniques used in the design and operation of logistics systems and integrated supply chains. The material is taught from a managerial perspective, with an emphasis on where and how specific tools can be used to improve the overall performance and reduce the total cost of a supply chain. We place a strong emphasis on the development and use of fundamental mathematical models to illustrate the underlying concepts involved in both intra- and inter-company logistics operations.
The main topic areas we will focus on this course are:
 

Demand Forecasting, Planning, and Management
	Inventory Planning, Management, and Control
	Transportation Planning, Management, and Execution
While our main objective is to develop and use models to help us analyze these situations, we will make heavy use of examples from industry to provide illustrations of the concepts in practice. This is neither a purely theoretical nor a case study course, but rather an applied analytical course that addresses real problems found in practice.

Supply chains are complex systems involving multiple businesses and organizations with different goals and objectives. Many different analytical methods and techniques are used by researchers and practitioners alike to better design and manage their supply chains. This business and management course introduces the primary methods and tools that you will encounter in your study and practice of supply chains. We focus on the application of these methods, not necessarily the theoretical underpinnings.
We will begin with an overview of introductory probability and decision analysis to ensure that students understand how uncertainty can be modeled. Next, we will move into basic statistics and regression. Finally, we will introduce optimization modeling from unconstrained to linear, non-linear, and mixed integer linear programming.
This is a hands-on course. Students will use spreadsheets extensively to apply these techniques and approaches in case studies drawn from actual supply chains.

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-mechanics-1d-scattering-central-mitx-8-04-3x</link>
                    <description>In this quantum physics course you will learn the basic concepts of scattering – phase-shifts, time delays, Levinson’s theorem, and resonances – in the simple context of one-dimensional problems. We then turn to the study of angular momentum and the motion of particles in three-dimensional central potentials. We learn about the radial equation and study the case of the hydrogen atom in detail.

This is the final course in a series which includes:

Quantum Mechanics: Wavefunctions, Operators, and Expectation Values
	Quantum Mechanics: Quantum Physics in 1D Potentials
	Quantum Mechanics: 1D Scattering and Central Potentials
The series is based on the MIT 8.04: Quantum Mechanics I. At MIT, 8.04 is the first of a three-course sequence in Quantum Mechanics, a cornerstone in the education of physics majors that prepares them for advanced and specialized studies in any field related to quantum physics.

After completing the 8.04x series, you will be ready to tackle the Mastering Quantum Mechanics course series on edX, which will be available in Spring 2018.</description>

                    <description>In this quantum physics course you will acquire concrete knowledge of quantum mechanics by learning to solve the Schrodinger equation for important classes of one-dimensional potentials. We study the associated energy eigenstates and bound states. The harmonic oscillator is solved using the differential equation as well as algebraically, using creation and annihilation operators. We discuss barrier penetration and the Ramsauer-Townsend effect.

This is the second course in a series which includes:

Quantum Mechanics: Wavefunctions, Operators, and Expectation Values
	Quantum Mechanics: Quantum Physics in 1D Potentials
	Quantum Mechanics: 1D Scattering and Central Potentials

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/supply-chain-design-mitx-ctl-sc2x-2</link>
                    <description>This Supply Chain Design course is part of the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management, offered by #1 ranked SCM Master's program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
CTL.SC2x Supply Chain Design covers all aspects involved in the design of supply chains for companies and organizations anywhere in the world. The course is divided into four main topic areas: Physical flow design, Supply chain finance, Information flow design, and Organization/Process design. In the design of physical flows, we show how to formulate and solve Transportation, Transshipment, Facility Location, and Network Design Problems. For financial flows we show how to translate supply chain concepts and actions into the language of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of a company. We cover Activity Based Costing, Working Capital, the Cash-to-Cash cycle and Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. The design of the information flow section describes how firms communicate with suppliers (procurement, risk contracts), internal resources (production planning, bills of materials, material requirements planning), and customers (Sales &amp; Operations Planning and other collaboration based processes). In the last section, we introduce performance metric design and organizational design within the supply chain organization focusing mainly on the centralize/decentralize decision.
The main topic areas we will focus on in this course are:

Supply Chain Network Design
	Supply Chain Finance
	Supplier Management
	Production and Demand Planning
	Process and Organizational Design
This course is indispensable if you’re considering a supply chain management career and, specifically, the positions of Supply Chain Analyst, Operations Manager, or Logistics Coordinator.</description>

          <staff:name> David Hardt </staff:name>
          <staff:title></staff:title>
          <staff:bio>Professor Hardt is a graduate of Lafayette College (BSME, 1972) and MIT (SM, PhD, 1978). He has been a member of the Mechanical Engineering faculty at MIT since 1979. His disciplinary focus is system dynamics and control as applied to manufacturing. His research has been on flexible automation, and process control, with an historical emphasis on welding and forming processes, and a current focus on polymer micro embossing. In welding, he pioneered the use of multivariable control techniques for modeling and control of GMAW, and demonstrated the use of adaptive control in these systems. In the forming processes, he concentrated on the use of in-process measurements and real-time modeling to reduce sensitivity to machine and material variations, and has developed a flexible tooling and closed loop shape control that has implemented in the aerospace industry with specific uses for repair part manufacture. His more recent work has been in the hot micro-embossing process for micro-fluidic device manufacture and scale-up of soft lithography methods using roll to roll processes. In both cases the theme of the work is novel equipment design and overall equipment and process statistical control

Prof. Hardt has taught classes in both Mechanical Engineering and Manufacturing, and has led the creation of a new graduate degree: Master of Engineering in Manufacturing" at MIT. This is the first professional degree offered by the ME Department at MIT, and is the culmination of many years of course and curriculum development.

Prof. Hardt served as Director of the MIT Laboratory for Manufacturing from 1985 - 1992 and as Engineering Co-Director for the MIT Leaders for Manufacturing Program from 1993 to 1998. From 1999 to 2011 he was the MIT Chair of the Singapore MIT Alliance (SMA) Program: "Manufacturing Systems and Technology", a research and teaching collaboration with Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. He was a member of the MIT Commission on Productivity in an Innovation Economy, and served on the Workforce team on the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership program (AMP 1.0).

                    <description>Mechanics is the study of the physics of motion and how it relates to applied forces. It lays the foundation of understanding the world around us through the how and why of motion.

This physics course is the first in a series of modules that covers calculus-based mechanics. This module reviews kinematics (the geometrical description of motion) in the context of one-dimensional, multi-dimensional, and circular motion. It also reviews Newton’s laws of motion and examines their application to a wide variety of cases.

This series of modules is based on the MIT subject 8.01: Physics I, required of all MIT undergraduates. The modules are:

Mechanics: Kinematics and Dynamics
	Mechanics: Momentum and Energy
	Mechanics: Rotational Dynamics

                    <title>A Global History of Architecture</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/global-history-architecture-mitx-4-605x-0</link>
                    <description>How do we understand architecture? One way of answering this question is by looking through the lens of history, beginning with First Societies and extending to the 16th century. This course in architectural history is not intended as a linear narrative, but rather aims to provide a more global view, by focusing on different architectural "moments."

How did the introduction of iron in the ninth century BCE impact regional politics and the development of architecture? How did new religious formations, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, produce new architectural understandings? What were the architectural consequences of the changing political landscape in northern Italy in the 14th century? How did rock-cut architecture move across space and time from West Asia to India to Africa? How did the emergence of corn impact the rise of religious and temple construction in Mexico?

Each lecture analyzes a particular architectural transformation arising from a dynamic cultural situation. Material covered in lectures will be supplemented by readings from the textbook A Global History of Architecture.

Join us on a journey around the globe and learn how architecture has developed and interacted with the world’s culture, religion, and history.</description>

                    <title>Quantum Mechanics: Wavefunctions, operators, and expectation values</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-mechanics-wavefunctions-mitx-8-04-1x</link>
                    <description>In this quantum physics course you will learn the basics of quantum mechanics. We begin with de Broglie waves, the wavefunction, and its probability interpretation. We then introduce the Schrodinger equation, inner products, and Hermitian operators. We also study the time-evolution of wave-packets, Ehrenfest’s theorem, and uncertainty relations.

This is the first course in a series which includes:

Quantum Mechanics: Wavefunctions, Operators, and Expectation Values
	Quantum Mechanics: Quantum Physics in 1D Potentials
	Quantum Mechanics: 1D Scattering and Central Potentials
The series is based on MIT 8.04: Quantum Mechanics I. At MIT, 8.04 is the first of a three-course sequence in Quantum Mechanics, a cornerstone in the education of physics majors that prepares them for advanced and specialized studies in any field related to quantum physics.

After completing the 8.04x series, you will be ready to tackle the Mastering Quantum Mechanics course series on edX, which will be available in Spring 2018.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/evaluacion-de-impacto-de-programas-mitx-jpal101spax-0</link>
                    <description>Este curso introduce las evaluaciones de impacto aleatorizadas (o experimentales) como una herramienta para probar y mejorar la eficacia de programas y políticas sociales.

El curso te entregará los conceptos fundamentales para entender en qué consisten las evaluaciones de impacto aleatorizadas, por qué son importantes, cómo se diseñan e implementan, y cómo usar sus resultados.

Combinando clases teóricas y casos de estudio basados en evaluaciones reales, el curso presta atención a aspectos como las virtudes de la metodología experimental, los distintos diseños de aleatorización posibles y qué situaciones pueden poner en riesgo la validez interna de un experimento.

Asimismo, enfatiza otros temas que son relevantes para cualquier tipo de evaluación de programas, tales como medir adecuadamente los resultados de interés, asegurar la calidad de los datos y usar los resultados en el diseño de programas y políticas nuevas.

El curso de Evaluación de Impacto de Programas Sociales está diseñado para múltiples tipos de audiencias: funcionarios de instituciones gubernamentales, ONGs, fundaciones y otras organizaciones que diseñan, implementan o financian programas sociales; así como investigadores, académicos y estudiantes en busca de nuevas herramientas de análisis.</description>

                    <title>Transfer Functions and the Laplace Transform</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/transfer-functions-laplace-transform-mitx-18-03lx</link>
                    <description>This course is about the Laplace Transform, a single very powerful tool for understanding the behavior of a wide range of mechanical and electrical systems: from helicopters to skyscrapers, from light bulbs to cell phones. This tool captures the behavior of the system and displays it in highly graphical form that is used every day by engineers to design complex systems.

This course is centered on the concept of the transfer function of a system. Also called the system function, the transfer function completely describes the response of a system to any input signal in a highly conceptual manner. This visualization occurs not in the time domain, where we normally observe behavior of systems, but rather in the “frequency domain.” We need a device for moving from the time domain to the frequency domain; this is the Laplace transform.

We will illustrate these principles using concrete mechanical and electrical systems such as tuned mass dampers and RLC circuits.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/democracy-development-perspectives-mitx-17-571x</link>
                    <description>On a continent once dominated by closed political systems, democratic political institutions have taken root in more than a dozen African countries over the past 20 years. In this course, you’ll learn about this remarkable experiment, and try to better understand both the opportunities and the challenges of democratic governance.

We have interviewed more than 50 African academics, politicians, leaders, and students about how democracy works, and in this course, we provide opportunities to learn from these various African experts.

Each week, MIT Professor Evan Lieberman will introduce key topics in the study of democratic development in Africa, and highlight key ideas and insights from various African colleagues. Students will gain a solid introduction to African political development using analytical tools from the social sciences.

The course is for anyone interested in gaining a better understanding of African politics; learning about relationship between democratic politics and the attainment of improved human development; and/or obtaining an introduction to political science approaches to these topics.</description>

                    <title>Visualizing Japan (1850s-1930s): Westernization, Protest, Modernity</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/visualizing-japan-1850s-1930s-harvardx-mitx-vjx-3</link>
                    <description>This MITx course was developed in collaboration with HarvardX and is co-taught by MIT and Harvard historians. You will examine Japanese history in a new way—through the images created by those who were there—and the skills and questions involved in reading history through images in the digital format. The introductory module considers methodologies historians use to “visualize” the past, followed by three modules that explore the themes of Westernization, in Commodore Perry’s 1853-54 expedition to Japan; social protest, in Tokyo’s 1905 Hibiya Riot; and modernity, as seen in the archives of the major Japanese cosmetics company, Shiseido.

VJx will cover the following topics in four modules:

Module 0: Introduction: New Historical Sources for a Digital Age (Professors Dower, Gordon, Miyagawa). Digitization has dramatically altered historians' access to primary sources, making large databases of the visual record readily accessible. How is historical methodology changing in response to this seismic shift? How can scholars, students, and the general public make optimal use of these new digital resources?
	Module 1: Black Ships &amp; Samurai (Professor Dower). Commodore Matthew Perry's 1853-54 expedition to force Japan to open its doors to the outside world is an extraordinary moment to look at by examining and comparing the visual representations left to us by both the American and Japanese sides of this encounter. This module also addresses the rapid Westernization undertaken by Japan in the half century following the Perry mission.
	Module 2: Social Protest in Imperial Japan: The Hibiya Riot of 1905 (Professor Gordon). The dramatic daily reports from participants in the massive "Hibiya Riot" in 1905, the first major social protest in the age of "imperial democracy" in Japan, offer a vivid and fresh perspective on the contentious domestic politics of an emerging imperial power.
	Module 3: Modernity in Interwar Japan: Shiseido &amp; Consumer Culture (Professors Dower, Gordon, Weisenfeld). Exploring the vast archives of the Shiseido cosmetics company opens a fascinating window on the emergence of consumer culture, modern roles for women, and global cosmopolitanism from the 'teens through the 1920s and even into the era of Japanese militarism and aggression in the 1930s. This module will also tap other Visualizing Cultures units on modernization and modernity.
The course is based on the MIT "Visualizing Cultures" website devoted to image-driven research on Japan and China since the 19th century (visualizingcultures.mit.edu). VJx is part of an expanding set of offerings in the Visualizing Japan XSeries. We will be offering two new courses in 2017 and 2018 respectively, Visualizing US Imperialism &amp; the Philippines (VPx) based on turn of the 20th century cartoons and photographs; and Visualizing the Birth of Modern Tokyo (VTx), a study of the “100 Views” of Tokyo. the new courses from MITx, which will accompany our existing courses, VJx and UTokyo001x: Visualizing Postwar Tokyo, by University of Tokyo.

NOTES:

For MIT students: VJx will continue to be part of 21F.027J Visualizing Japan in the Modern World, a residential course taught by Professor Miyagawa in Fall semesters.

In addition to MITx and HarvardX, this project is supported by the U.S. Japan Foundation, the University of Tokyo, and the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies, Harvard University.

          <staff:bio>Gennifer Weisenfeld is Professor of Art, Art History &amp; Visual Studies at Duke University. Her field of research is modern and contemporary Japanese art history, design, and visual culture. Her first book Mavo: Japanese Artists and the Avant-Garde, 1905-1931 (University of California Press, 2002) addresses the relationship between high art and mass culture in the aesthetic politics of the avant-garde in 1920s Japan. And her most recent book Imaging Disaster: Tokyo and the Visual Culture of Japan’s Great Earthquake of 1923 (University of California Press, 2012, Japanese edition, Kantō Daishinsai no Sōzōryoku: Saigai to Fukkō no Shikaku Bunkaron, Seidosha, forthcoming 2014) examines how visual culture has mediated the historical understanding of Japan’s worst national disaster of the twentieth century. In addition to co-editing the volume Crossing the Sea: Essays on East Asian Art in Honor of Professor Yoshiaki Shimizu, with Gregory Levine and Andrew Watsky (Princeton University Press, 2012), she has written numerous journal articles, including several on the history of Japanese design, such as, “‘From Baby’s First Bath’: Kaō Soap and Modern Japanese Commercial Design” (The Art Bulletin, September 2004) and the core essay on MIT’s award-winning website Visualizing Cultures on the Shiseido company’s advertising design. She is currently working on a new book on the history of Japanese advertising and commercial design titled The Fine Art of Persuasion: Corporate Advertising Design, Nation, and Empire in Modern Japan.</staff:bio>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/u-lab-leading-emerging-future-mitx-15-671-1x-0</link>
                    <description>We live in a time of disruptive change. How to activate our capacity to lean into the emerging future may well be the most important leadership challenge of our time. How do you cultivate curiosity, compassion and courage in the face of prejudice, anger and fear?

This course is an introduction to a method called Theory U, developed at MIT, for leading such change in business, government, and civil society contexts worldwide.

The only prerequisite for this course is u.lab 15.671.0x, an introductory overview--which you can complete in just 90 minutes. Building on the intention you set in u.lab 15.671.0x, 15.671.1x will help you to apply the Theory U method to an issue that matters to you, with fellow change makers locally and around the world. Join us as we co-pioneer new approaches to today’s most important social and environmental challenges using a method of awareness based systems change.</description>

                    <description>How does the final velocity on a zip line change when the starting point is raised or lowered by a matter of centimeters?  What is the accuracy of a GPS position measurement?  How fast should an airplane travel to minimize fuel consumption? The answers to all of these questions involve the derivative. 

But what is the derivative?  You will learn its mathematical notation, physical meaning, geometric interpretation, and be able to move fluently between these representations of the derivative.  You will discover how to differentiate any function you can think up, and develop a powerful intuition to be able to sketch the graph of many functions.  You will make linear and quadratic approximations of functions to simplify computations and gain intuition for system behavior.  You will learn to maximize and minimize functions to optimize properties like cost, efficiency, energy, and power.

                    <title>Entrepreneurial Land Redevelopment Approach: Land Readjustment</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/entrepreneurial-land-redevelopment-mitx-stl-161x-0</link>
                    <description>This course examines and presents processes of designing and implementing land readjustment in the context of developing countries.

Land readjustment is an alternative land-assembly approach to government compulsory purchase (often referred to as eminent domain) and voluntary market transaction. In the land readjustment process, a public or private agency invites property owners to become stakeholders in a redevelopment project and to contribute their lands to the project as investment capital. In return, each property owner receives a land site of at least equal value in the vicinity of the original site upon project completion. After all properties in the district are assembled, the combined land sites are subdivided to make space for wider roads and other local infrastructure.

The conventional approaches to land assembly are often conflict-ridden. Through this course, practitioners can add another viable option to their toolbox by learning about land readjustment as an alternative approach to urbanization in developing countries.

Land readjustment has been shown to reduce the initial capital requirement for land assembly, discourage holdouts, and minimize massive relocation of existing residents. When applying land readjustment at the right time and in the right place, this approach could mediate a major hindrance of land redevelopment in countries that are facing rapid urbanization.      </description>

                    <title>Launching Innovation in Schools</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/launching-innovation-schools-mitx-microsoft-education-11-154x-0</link>
                    <description>Every great teacher and every great school constantly work towards creating better learning conditions for students. Just as we hope our students become lifelong learners, we as educators should be constantly learning and improving. This education course is for school leaders of all kinds (from teacher-leaders to principals to superintendents) who are launching innovation in schools—starting new efforts to work together to improve teaching and learning.

Over seven weeks, you and your classmates will complete a cycle of study, experimentation, and reflection to gain confidence and skills to lead instructional improvement efforts. Through experiential activities and assignments, you will begin working with colleagues to envision the next level of work for your team or organization, to launch a new initiative, and to measure your progress along the way. Based on the work of Justin Reich (Teaching Systems Lab, MIT) and Peter Senge (MIT Sloan), this course will focus on visioning and capacity-building, with an emphasis on collaboration and building partnerships with stakeholders at multiple levels.

At the end of the course, you will have started the process of launching an instructional improvement initiative in your school or learning environment, and you will better understand yourself as a leader and change agent. You will have made connections with peers who are also undertaking this important work.

This course has been funded by Microsoft and is part of the Microsoft K-12 Education Leadership initiative developed to provide resources to K-12 school leaders around the world as they address the unique needs of their schools in a changing educational and technology landscape.

                    <title>Supply Chain Dynamics</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/supply-chain-dynamics-mitx-ctl-sc3x-1</link>
                    <description>Supply Chains are complex systems involving multiple firms and organizations with different goals and objectives. Additionally, there are external forces and trends that can impact (positively or negatively) a supply chain’s efficiency and effectiveness. Understanding the dynamics and risks within supply chains, both large and small, is key to being a successful supply chain professional. 

This course builds on the fundamental models introduced in SC1x and the design trade-offs covered in SC2x. It is essentially a capstone in understanding how to successfully model, design, and manage a supply chain in any industry. We will divide the course into three sections. 

First, we will introduce the field of System Dynamics. Developed at MIT, system dynamics is an approach that examines and models complex systems that feature interacting, non-linear, and dynamic elements. The objective is to better understand the underlying features of a complex system and to recommend policies and other actions to improve overall performance. 

Second, we will explore the concepts of supply chain risk. Supply chains are subject to a wide number of potential disruptions – from both within and outside of the supply chain.  Students will understand how supply chains can be better designed and managed to not only mitigate the downside of supply chain disruption but also to leverage and capture any upside. 

Finally, the students will engage in a series of more extended case studies and simulations that demonstrate these complex relationships. Actual case studies and examples from companies will be used to help students better prepare for actual situations.

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-solid-state-chemistry-mitx-3-091x-5</link>
                    <description>This first-year University chemistry course explores the basic principles of the chemical bond by studying the properties of solids. Properties such as stiffness, electrical conductivity, thermal expansion, strength, and optical properties are the vehicle by which you can learn a great deal of practical chemistry. 

You will see how experts use their knowledge of trends in the periodic table to predict the properties of materials. 3.091x is an engineering course so there is an emphasis on applications and how materials are used. The on-campus version of the course has been taught for over forty years and is one of the largest classes at MIT.

This course will cover the relationship between electronic structure, chemical bonding, and atomic order, and characterization of atomic arrangements in crystalline and amorphous solids: metals, ceramics, semiconductors, and polymers (including proteins). There will be topical coverage of organic chemistry, solution chemistry, acid-base equilibria, electrochemistry, biochemistry, chemical kinetics, diffusion, and phase diagrams. Examples will be drawn from industrial practice (including the environmental impact of chemical processes), from energy generation and storage (e.g., batteries and fuel cells), and from emerging technologies (e.g., photonic and biomedical devices). </description>

                    <description>Spaceflight is exciting, and you don’t have to be a “Rocket Scientist” to share in the excitement! 16.00x makes the basics of spaceflight accessible to everyone. Join MIT Professor Jeffrey Hoffman, a former NASA astronaut who made five spaceflights and was the first astronaut to log 1000 hours on the Space Shuttle, as he teaches you the core principles behind space travel and exploration. The course will cover how rockets work, how spacecraft move in orbit, how we create artificial environments inside spacecraft to keep astronauts alive and healthy, what it’s like living in a world without gravity, how the human body adapts to space, and how spacewalks happen, plus more. Many lessons will be illustrated with Professor Hoffman’s own experiences in space. 

 

Advanced Notice of a Future Spaceflight Course

Students who are interested in taking more online space-related courses should be aware that Professor Hoffman will be presenting a new online course in the fall of 2018 about “Systems Engineering and the Space Shuttle”. 16.00x is good preparation for this new course.</description>

          <staff:bio>Dr.&amp;nbsp;Jeffrey Hoffman is a professor in MIT’s Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He received a BA in Astronomy (summa cum laude) from Amherst College (1966); a PhD in Astrophysics from Harvard University (1971); and an MSc in Materials Science from Rice University (1988). As a NASA astronaut (1978-1997) he made five space flights, becoming the first astronaut to log 1000 hours of flight time aboard the Space Shuttle. Dr. Hoffman was Payload Commander of STS-46, the first flight of the US-Italian Tethered Satellite System. He has performed four spacewalks, including the first unplanned, contingency spacewalk in NASA’s history (STS-51D; April 1985) and the initial repair/rescue mission for the Hubble Space Telescope (STS-61; December 1993). As the Astronaut Office representative for Extravehicular Activity, he helped develop and carry out tests of advanced high-pressure space suit designs and of new tools and procedures needed for the assembly of the International Space Station. Following his astronaut career, Dr. Hoffman spent four years as NASA’s European Representative, working at the US Embassy in Paris.&amp;nbsp; In August 2001, Dr. Hoffman joined the MIT faculty, where he teaches courses on space operations and space systems design. His primary research interests are in improving the technology of space suits and designing innovative space systems for human and robotic space exploration. Dr. Hoffman is director of the Massachusetts Space Grant Consortium, responsible for space-related educational activities. He is Deputy Principal Investigator of an experiment on NASA’s Mars 2020 mission, which will for the first time produce oxygen from extraterrestrial material, a critical step in the future of human space exploration. In 2007, Dr. Hoffman was elected to the US Astronaut Hall of Fame.

                    <title>The Analytics Edge</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/analytics-edge-mitx-15-071x-3</link>
                    <description>In the last decade, the amount of data available to organizations has reached unprecedented levels. Data is transforming business, social interactions, and the future of our society. In this course, you will learn how to use data and analytics to give an edge to your career and your life. We will examine real world examples of how analytics have been used to significantly improve a business or industry. These examples include Moneyball, eHarmony, the Framingham Heart Study, Twitter, IBM Watson, and Netflix. Through these examples and many more, we will teach you the following analytics methods: linear regression, logistic regression, trees, text analytics, clustering, visualization, and optimization. We will be using the statistical software R to build models and work with data. The contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class (The Analytics Edge). It is a challenging class, but it will enable you to apply analytics to real-world applications. 

The class will consist of lecture videos, which are broken into small pieces, usually between 4 and 8 minutes each. After each lecture piece, we will ask you a “quick question” to assess your understanding of the material. There will also be a recitation, in which one of the teaching assistants will go over the methods introduced with a new example and data set. Each week will have a homework assignment that involves working in R or LibreOffice with various data sets. (R is a free statistical and computing software environment we’ll use in the course. See the Software FAQ below for more info). In the middle of the class, we will run an analytics competition, and at the end of the class there will be a final exam, which will be similar to the homework assignments.</description>

                    <title>Introduction to Probability: Part 1 - The Fundamentals</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-probability-part-1-mitx-6-041-1x</link>
                    <description>The world is full of uncertainty: accidents, storms, unruly financial markets, and noisy communications. The world is also full of data. Probabilistic modeling and the related field of statistical inference are the keys to analyzing data and making scientifically sound predictions.
This is Part 1 of a 2-part sequence on the basic tools of probabilistic modeling. Part 1 introduces the general framework of probability models, multiple discrete or continuous random variables, expectations, conditional distributions, and various powerful tools of general applicability. Part 2 will then continue into further topics that include laws of large numbers, the main tools of Bayesian inference methods, and an introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains).
The contents of the two parts of the course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class, which has been offered and continuously refined over more than 50 years. It is a challenging class, but will enable you to apply the tools of probability theory to real-world applications or your research.
Probabilistic models use the language of mathematics. But instead of relying on the traditional "theorem - proof" format, we develop the material in an intuitive -- but still rigorous and mathematically precise -- manner. Furthermore, while the applications are multiple and evident, we emphasize the basic concepts and methodologies that are universally applicable.Photo by User: Pablo Ruiz Múzquiz on Flickr.

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/evaluating-social-programs-mitx-jpal101x-6</link>
                    <description>Learn why evaluations matter and how they can be used to rigorously measure the social impact of development programs. This practical course will provide a thorough understanding of randomized evaluations, with pragmatic step-by-step training for conducting one’s own evaluation. Through a combination of lectures and case studies from real randomized evaluations, the course will focus on the benefits and methods of randomization, choosing an appropriate sample size, and common threats and pitfalls to the validity of an experiment. While the course is centered around the why, how, and when of randomized evaluations, it will also impart insights on the importance of a needs assessment, measuring outcomes effectively, quality control, and monitoring methods that are useful for all kinds of evaluations. 

This social impact course is designed for people from a variety of backgrounds: managers and researchers from international development organizations, foundations, governments, and non-governmental organizations from around the world, as well as trained economists looking to retool.</description>

                    <title>Mechanics of Deformable Structures: Part 1</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/mechanics-deformable-structures-part-1-mitx-2-02-1x</link>
                    <description>Many natural and man-made structures can be modeled as assemblages of interconnected structural elements loaded along their axis (bars), in torsion (shafts) and in bending (beams). In this course you will learn to use equations for static equilibrium, geometric compatibility and constitutive material response to analyze these structural assemblages.
This course also provides an introduction to behavior in which the shape of the structure is permanently changed by loading the material beyond its elastic limit (plasticity), and behavior in which the structural response changes over time (viscoelasticity).
This is the second course in a 3-part series. In this series you will learn how mechanical engineers can use analytical methods and “back of the envelope” calculations to predict structural behavior.  The three courses in the series are:
Part 1 – 2.01x: Elements of Structures. (Elastic response of Structural Elements: Bars, Shafts, Beams). Next session starts October 2017
Part 2 – 2.02.1x Mechanics of Deformable Structures: Part 1. (Assemblages of Elastic, Elastic-Plastic, and Viscoelastic Structural Elements).
 Part 3 – 2.02.2x Mechanics of Deformable Structures: Part 2. (Multi-axial Loading and Deformation. Energy Methods). Next session starts October 2018
These courses are based on the first subject in solid mechanics for MIT Mechanical Engineering students.  Join them and learn to rely on the notions of equilibrium, geometric compatibility, and constitutive material response to ensure that your structures will perform their specified mechanical function without failing.</description>

                    <description>2.01x introduces principles of structural analysis and strength of materials in applications to three essential types of elastic load-bearing elements: bars in axial loading, axisymmetric shafts in torsion, and symmetric beams in bending. The course covers fundamental concepts of continuum mechanics, including internal resultants, displacement field, stress, and strain.
While emphasizing analytical techniques, the course also provides an introduction to computing environments (MATLAB) and numerical methods (Finite Elements). 
This is the first course in a 3-part series. In this series you will learn how mechanical engineers can use analytical methods and “back of the envelope” calculations to predict structural behavior.  The three courses in the series are:

                    <description>What is the relationship between the mind and the body? Can computers think? Do we perceive reality as it is? Can there be a science of consciousness?

This course explores these questions and others. It is a thorough, rigorous introduction to contemporary philosophy of mind.

According to many scientists and philosophers, explaining the nature of consciousness is the deepest intellectual challenge of all. If you find consciousness at all puzzling, this is a great place to start learning more.</description>

                    <title>Mechanical Behavior of Materials, Part 3: Time Dependent Behavior and Failure</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/mechanical-behavior-materials-part-3-mitx-3-032-3x-1</link>
                    <description>All around us, engineers are creating materials whose properties are exactly tailored to their purpose. This course is the third of three in a series of mechanics courses from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT. Taken together, these courses provide similar content to the MIT subject 3.032: Mechanical Behavior of Materials.
The 3.032x series provides an introduction to the mechanical behavior of materials, from both the continuum and atomistic points of view. At the continuum level, we learn how forces and displacements translate into stress and strain distributions within the material. At the atomistic level, we learn the mechanisms that control the mechanical properties of materials.  Examples are drawn from metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, biomaterials, composites and cellular materials.
Part 3 covers viscoelasticity (behavior intermediate to that of an elastic solid and that of a viscous fluid), plasticity (permanent deformation), creep in crystalline materials (time dependent behavior), brittle fracture (rapid crack propagation) and fatigue (failure due to repeated loading of a material).</description>

                    <title>Mechanical Behavior of Materials, Part 2: Stress Transformations, Beams, Columns, and Cellular Solids</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/mechanical-behavior-materials-part-2-mitx-3-032-2x-1</link>
                    <description>All around us, engineers are creating materials whose properties are exactly tailored to their purpose. This course is the second of three in a series of mechanics courses from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at MIT. Taken together, these courses provide similar content to the MIT subject 3.032: Mechanical Behavior of Materials.

The 3.032x series provides an introduction to the mechanical behavior of materials, from both the continuum and atomistic points of view. At the continuum level, we learn how forces and displacements translate into stress and strain distributions within the material. At the atomistic level, we learn the mechanisms that control the mechanical properties of materials. Examples are drawn from metals, ceramics, glasses, polymers, biomaterials, composites and cellular materials.

Part 1 covers stress-strain behavior, topics in linear elasticity and the atomic basis for linear elasticity, and composite materials.

Part 2 covers stress transformations, beam bending, column buckling, and cellular materials.

Part 3 covers viscoelasticity (behavior intermediate to that of an elastic solid and that of a viscous fluid), plasticity (permanent deformation), creep in crystalline materials (time dependent behavior), brittle fracture (rapid crack propagation) and fatigue (failure due to repeated loading of a material).</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/calculus-1c-coordinate-systems-infinite-mitx-18-01-3x-0</link>
                    <description>How did Newton describe the orbits of the planets? To do this, he created calculus.  But he used a different coordinate system more appropriate for planetary motion.  We will learn to shift our perspective to do calculus with parameterized curves and polar coordinates. And then we will dive deep into exploring the infinite to gain a deeper understanding and powerful descriptions of functions.

How does a computer make accurate computations? Absolute precision does not exist in the real world, and computers cannot handle infinitesimals or infinity. Fortunately, just as we approximate numbers using the decimal system, we can approximate functions using series of much simpler functions. These approximations provide a powerful framework for scientific computing and still give highly accurate results. They allow us to solve all sorts of engineering problems based on models of our world represented in the language of calculus.

Changing Perspectives
	Parametric Equations
		Polar Coordinates
	
	Series and Polynomial Approximations
	Series and Convergence
		Taylor Series and Power Series
	
This course, in combination with Parts 1 and 2, covers the AP* Calculus BC curriculum.

                    <title>Technology Evaluation for Global Development</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/technology-evaluation-global-development-mitx-cite101x</link>
                    <description>When a person lives on less than $2 a day — as some 2.7 billion people around the world do — there isn’t room for a product like a solar lantern or a water filter to fail. Investment in failing products undermines future innovation by reducing confidence and depleting scarce resources.

It’s a challenge faced every day by development agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and consumers themselves. With so many products on the market, how do you choose the right one?

This course, developed by MIT’s Comprehensive Initiative on Technology Evaluation (CITE) will explore the fundamentals of technology evaluation for global development. It includes a deep dive into CITE’s 3S methodology, looking at products from three angles:

Suitability—does a product perform its intended purpose?
	Scalability—can the supply chain effectively reach consumers?
	Sustainability—is it a product that can be used correctly, consistently, and continuously over time?
This course is designed for academics and global development practitioners; those interested in conducting their own technology evaluations to promote data-driven decisions through research or development practice. </description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/supply-chain-fundamentals-mitx-ctl-sc1x-2</link>
                    <description>This Supply Chain Fundamentals course is part of the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management, offered by #1 ranked SCM Master's program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The CTL.SC1x Supply Chain Fundamentals course provides the foundational skills for supply chain management and logistics. You will learn how to develop and apply analytic tools, approaches, and techniques used in the design and operation of logistics systems and integrated supply chains. The material is taught from a managerial perspective, with an emphasis on where and how specific tools can be used to improve the overall performance and reduce the total cost of a supply chain. We place a strong emphasis on the development and use of fundamental mathematical models to illustrate the underlying concepts involved in both intra- and inter-company logistics operations.

The main topic areas we will focus on this course are:

Demand Forecasting, Planning, and Management
	Inventory Planning, Management, and Control
	Transportation Planning, Management, and Execution
While our main objective is to develop and use models to help us analyze these situations, we will make heavy use of examples from industry to provide illustrations of the concepts in practice. This is neither a purely theoretical nor a case study course, but rather an applied analytical course that addresses real problems found in practice.

                    <title>Effective Field Theory</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/effective-field-theory-mitx-8-eftx</link>
                    <description>8.EFTx is an online version of MIT's graduate Effective Field Theory course. The course follows the MIT on-campus class 8.851 as it was given by Professor Iain Stewart in the Fall of 2013, and includes his video lectures, resource material on various effective theories, and a series of problems to facilitate learning the material. Anyone can register for the online version of the course. When the course is being taught on campus, students at MIT or Harvard may also register for 8.851 for course credit.

Effective field theory (EFT) provides a fundamental framework to describe physical systems with quantum field theory. In this course you will learn both how to construct EFTs and how to apply them in a variety of situations. We will cover the majority of the common tools that are used by different effective field theories. In particular: identifying degrees of freedom and symmetries, formulating power counting expansions (both dimensional and non-dimensional), field redefinitions, bottom-up and top-down effective theories, fine-tuned effective theories, matching and Wilson coefficients, reparameterization invariance, and various examples of advanced renormalization group techniques. Examples of effective theories we will cover are the Standard Model as an effective field theory, integrating out the massive W, Z, Higgs, and top, chiral perturbation theory, non-relativistic effective field theories including those with a large scattering length, static sources and Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET), and a theory for collider physics, the Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET).

Course Flow

Since this is an advanced graduate physics course, you will find that self-motivation and interaction with others is essential to learning the material. The purpose of the online course is to set you up with a foundation, to teach you to speak the language of EFT, and to connect you with other students and researchers that are interested in learning or broadening their exposure to this subject. Each week you will complete automatically graded homework problems to test your understanding and to help you master the material. You are expected to discuss the homework with other people in the class, but your online responses must be done individually. To facilitate these interactions there will be a forum for student-to-student discussions, with threads to cover different topics, and moderators with experience in this field. Student learning and discussions will also be prompted by questions posed after each lecture topic.

There will be no tests or final exam, but at the end of the course each student will give a 30-minute presentation on an EFT topic of their choosing. The subject of effective field theory is rich and diverse, and far broader than we will be able to cover in a single course. The presentations will create an opportunity for you to learn about additional subjects beyond those in lecture from your fellow students. To facilitate this learning opportunity, each student will be required to watch and grade five presentations from among their fellow students.

Since this is a graduate course, we anticipate that learning the subject and having the 8.EFTx materials available as an online resource will be more valuable to most of you than obtaining a grade. Therefore anyone who registers for the course will be able to retain access to the course materials after the course has ended. Note that when the course is archival mode that the problems can be attempted and checked in the same manner as when the course was running.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/socially-responsible-real-estate-mitx-stl-162x</link>
                    <description>How can you determine if a proposed real estate development project is socially responsible? Or determine whether the developer used the tools of social impact assessment (SIA), environmental impact assessment (EIA), and public consultation effectively?

This course will teach you how to evaluate a development project and practice socially responsible real estate yourself by applying SIA, EIA, and consultation methods. It is also designed to help students build their own personal theory of what constitutes socially responsible real estate development.

Taught by a professor with more than forty-five years of teaching experience at MIT, using an applied case study method, this course will open new opportunities for real estate developers and urban planners to see how SIA, EIA, and stakeholder engagement are the keys to creating socially-responsible real estate development throughout the world. </description>

                    <title>Molecular Biology – Part 2: Transcription and Transposition</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/molecular-biology-part-2-transcription-mitx-7-28-2x-1</link>
                    <description>In Part 2 of this Molecular Biology course, you’ll explore transcription of DNA to RNA, a key part of the central dogma of biology and the first step of gene expression.

Did you know that transposable elements, the genetic information that can move from location to location, make up roughly 50 % of the human genome? Did you know that scientists have linked their movement into specific genes to the causes of certain diseases? You’ll also learn how these “jumping genes” work and how scientists study them in Molecular Biology: Transcription and Transposition.

Are you ready to go beyond the “what" of scientific information presented in textbooks and explore how scientists deduce the details of these molecular models?

Take a behind-the-scenes look at modern molecular genetics, from the classic experimental events that identified the proteins and elements involved in transcription and transposition to cutting-edge assays that apply the power of genome sequencing. We've designed the problems in this course to build your experimental design and data analysis skills.

Let’s explore the limits of our current knowledge about the transcription machinery and mechanisms of transposition. If you are up for the challenge, join us in 7.28.2x Molecular Biology: Transcription and Transposition.</description>

                    <description>In Part 3 of 7.28x, you’ll explore translation of mRNA to protein, a key part of the central dogma of biology. Do you know how RNA turnover or RNA splicing affects the outcome of translation? Although not official steps in the central dogma, the mechanisms of RNA processing strongly influence gene expression.

Are you ready to go beyond the “what" of scientific information presented in textbooks and explore how scientists deduce the details of these molecular models?

Take a behind-the-scenes look at modern molecular biology, from the classic experimental events that identified the proteins and elements involved in translation and RNA splicing to cutting-edge assays that apply the power of genome sequencing. Do you feel confident in your ability to design molecular biology experiments and interpret data from them?

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/supply-chain-design-mitx-ctl-sc2x-1</link>
                    <description>This Supply Chain Design course is part of the MITx MicroMasters Credential in Supply Chain Management, offered by #1 ranked SCM Master's program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

CTL.SC2x Supply Chain Design covers all aspects involved in the design of supply chains for companies and organizations anywhere in the world. The course is divided into four main topic areas: Physical flow design, Supply chain finance, Information flow design, and Organization/Process design. In the design of physical flows, we show how to formulate and solve Transportation, Transshipment, Facility Location, and Network Design Problems. For financial flows we show how to translate supply chain concepts and actions into the language of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of a company. We cover Activity Based Costing, Working Capital, the Cash-to-Cash cycle and Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. The design of the information flow section describes how firms communicate with suppliers (procurement, risk contracts), internal resources (production planning, bills of materials, material requirements planning), and customers (Sales &amp; Operations Planning and other collaboration based processes). In the last section, we introduce performance metric design and organizational design within the supply chain organization focusing mainly on the centralize/decentralize decision.

The main topic areas we will focus on in this course are:

Supply Chain Network Design
	Supply Chain Finance
	Supplier Management
	Production and Demand Planning
	Process and Organizational Design
This course is indispensable if you’re considering a supply chain management career and, specifically, the positions of Supply Chain Analyst, Operations Manager, or Logistics Coordinator.

                    <title>Introduction to Philosophy: God, Knowledge and Consciousness</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-philosophy-god-knowledge-mitx-24-00x-2</link>
                    <description>This philosophy course has two goals. The first goal is to introduce you to the things that philosophers think about. We will look at some perennial philosophical problems:

Is there a God?
	What is knowledge, and how do we get it?
	What is the place of our consciousness in the physical world?
	Do we have free will?
	How do we persist over time, as our bodily and psychological traits change?
The second goal is to get you thinking philosophically yourself. This will help you develop your critical reasoning and argumentative skills more generally. Along the way we will draw from late, great classical authors and influential contemporary figures.

To help enhance your learning experience, this course offers instructor grading. If you choose to pursue a verified certificate, a professional philosopher will carefully read, grade and comment upon your work. Though all residential philosophy courses at MIT, and other major universities, offer instructor grading, this is an innovation in the world of MOOCs. Students will test their ideas against, and receive individual advice from, professional philosophers. We believe that this is the best way to learn philosophy.

Verified learners will be eligible for the MITx Philosophy Award and (for students presently in high school) the MITx High School Philosophy Award. The awards will be given for outstanding written work by the MIT Philosophy Department. In addition, award winners will be profiled on the MIT Philosophy website.

NOTE: Enrollment for instructor grading will be capped.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/calculus-1b-integration-mitx-18-01-2x-0</link>
                    <description>How long should the handle of your spoon be so that your fingers do not burn while mixing chocolate fondue? Can you find a shape that has finite volume, but infinite surface area? How does the weight of the rider change the trajectory of a zip line ride? These and many other questions can be answered by harnessing the power of the integral. 

But what is an integral? You will learn to interpret it geometrically as an area under a graph, and discover its connection to the derivative.  You will encounter functions that you cannot integrate without a computer and develop a big bag of tricks to attack the functions that you can integrate by hand. The integral is vital in engineering design, scientific analysis, probability and statistics. You will use integrals to find centers of mass, the stress on a beam during construction, the power exerted by a motor, and the distance traveled by a rocket.

1. Modeling the Integral

Differentials and Antiderivatives
	Differential Equations
	Separation of Variables
2. Theory of Integration

Mean Value Theorem
	Definition of the Integral and the First Fundamental Theorem
	Second Fundamental Theorem
3. Applications

Areas and Volumes
	Average Value and Probability
	Arc Length and Surface Area
4. Techniques of Integration

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/atomic-optical-physics-light-forces-mitx-8-422-4x</link>
                    <description>In this physics course, you will learn about the spontaneous and stimulated light force and friction force in molasses and optical standing waves. You will also study light forces in the dressed atom picture. The course will discuss the techniques of magneto-optical traps and sub-Doppler and sub-recoil cooling.

This course is a part of a series of courses to introduce concepts and current frontiers of atomic physics, and to prepare you for cutting-edge research:

8.422.1x: Quantum states and dynamics of photons
	8.422.2x: Atom-photon interactions
	8.422.3x: Optical Bloch equations and open system dynamics
	8.422.4x: Light forces and laser cooling
	8.422.5x: Ultracold atoms and ions for many-body physics and quantum information science
At MIT, the content of the five courses makes the second of a two-semester sequence (8.421 and 8.422) for graduate students interested in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. This sequence is required for Ph.D. students doing research in this field.

Completing the series allows you to pursue advanced study and research in cold atoms, as well as specialized topics in condensed matter physics. In these five courses you will learn about the following topics:

quantum states and dynamics of photons
	photon-atom interactions: basics and semiclassical approximations
	open system dynamics
	optical Bloch equations
	applications and limits of the optical Bloch equations
	dressed atoms
	light force
	laser cooling
	cold atoms
	evaporative cooling
	Bose-Einstein condensation
	quantum algorithms and protocols
	ion traps and magnetic traps

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/atomic-optical-physics-optical-bloch-mitx-8-422-3x</link>
                    <description>This physics course presents a general derivation of the master equation and the optical Bloch equations. You will learn about various solutions of the optical Bloch equations, and you will discuss the quantum Monte Carlo wavefunction approach. The course will conclude with a discussion of unraveling open system quantum dynamics.

This course is a part of a series of courses to introduce concepts and current frontiers of atomic physics, and to prepare you for cutting-edge research:

8.422.1x: Quantum states and dynamics of photons
	8.422.2x: Atom-photon interactions
	8.422.3x: Optical Bloch equations and open system dynamics
	8.422.4x: Light forces and laser cooling
	8.422.5x: Ultracold atoms and ions for many-body physics and quantum information science
At MIT, the content of the five courses makes the second of a two-semester sequence (8.421 and 8.422) for graduate students interested in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics. This sequence is required for Ph.D. students doing research in this field.

Completing the series allows you to pursue advanced study and research in cold atoms, as well as specialized topics in condensed matter physics. In these five courses you will learn about the following topics:

quantum states and dynamics of photons
	photon-atom interactions: basics and semiclassical approximations
	open system dynamics
	optical Bloch equations
	applications and limits of the optical Bloch equations
	dressed atoms
	light force
	laser cooling
	cold atoms
	evaporative cooling
	Bose-Einstein condensationquantum algorithms and protocols
	ion traps and magnetic traps.

                    <title>Discrete-Time Signal Processing</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/discrete-time-signal-processing-mitx-6-341x-1</link>
                    <description>6.341x is designed to provide both an in-depth and an intuitive understanding of the theory behind modern discrete-time signal processing systems and applications. The course begins with a review and extension of the basics of signal processing including a discussion of group delay and minimum-phase systems, and the use of discrete-time (DT) systems for processing of continuous-time (CT) signals. The course develops flow-graph and block diagram structures including lattice filters for implementing DT systems, and techniques for the design of DT filters. Parametric signal modeling and the efficient implementation of DT multirate and sampling rate conversion systems are discussed and developed. An in-depth development of the DFT and its computation as well as its use for spectral analysis and for filtering is presented. This component of the course includes a careful and insightful development of the relationship between the time-dependent Fourier transform and the use of filter banks for both spectral analysis and signal coding.

6.341x is organized around eleven units each typically consisting of a set of two to four topics. The source material for learning each topic includes suggested reading in the course text, clarifying notes, other related reading, and video excerpts and will include an interactive on-line discussion forum. The course text is the widely used text by Oppenheim and Schafer (third edition). The video segments are adapted from live video recordings of the MIT residential course. 
Each topic includes a set of automatically-graded exercises for self-assessment and to help in digesting and understanding the basics of the topic, and in some cases to preview topics. A typical unit in the course concludes with a set of more extensive problems to help in integrating the topics and developing a deeper understanding. Automatic grading of your answers to these problems as well as solutions will be provided.

6.341x and this freely-available version were developed through the support and encouragement of the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, the MIT Office of Digital Learning, and the MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics.

                    <title>Shaping the Future of Work</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/shaping-future-work-mitx-15-662x-1</link>
                    <description>The goal of this course is to explore and develop plans of action for improving the job and career opportunities for today and tomorrow’s workforce. At this time, there aren’t enough good jobs or educational opportunities in the U.S. or globally to meet the aspirations and needs of all who want and need to work or to deliver on the expectation that every generation should achieve a higher standard of living for themselves and their families than their parent’s generation. This is a fundamental ideal that drives people all over the world. In the U.S., we call it the American Dream.

If we take the right actions, we can shape the future of work in ways that meet the needs of workers, families, and their economies and societies. To do so, we first have to understand how the world of work is changing, how firms can compete and prosper and support good jobs and careers, and how to update the policies and practices governing the world of work.

We also have to understand and better address the deep divisions and inequalities in societies that threaten the future of our economies and democracies. We will address these by using the materials from the course to build a new social contract across business, labor, government, and education.  You will shape the features of the new social contract as we go through the course and then vote on how well the overall social contract generated by the class meets your expectations for the future.

In this business and management course, we’ll start by tracing the history of work and employment that has made the economy work so well in the past. And we’ll uncover what’s gone wrong, in order to figure out new solutions that fit today’s workforce, economy, and society. We’ll also take you on a personal journey, where you will learn what employers expect in today’s world of work—the skills, flexibility, and knowledge that are crucial for success in the contemporary workplace. We’ll examine what has to happen in order for employers, workers, governments, and regulators to come together to forge new policies, rules, and understandings for governing the world of work in the 21st century. We’ll make this all come alive by highlighting the experiences, contributions, and aspirations of real people who are working right now to address these challenges.

So join us, and let’s get started on shaping the future of work.</description>

                    <description>수업에 관하여

고객이 나를 위해 무엇을 해줄 것인지 생각하지 말고, 내가 고객을 위해 무엇을 해줄 것인지 생각해라.

기업가정신 101 에서는 고객의 관점에서 세상을 바라보는 방법을 배웠습니다. 세상을 바라보는 참 멋진 관점이었죠?

그러나 아이디어를 구체화하는 여정은 여기서 멈추지않습니다. 물론 끝에 어느정도 가까이 왔지만 정말 끝에 다다르기 까지는 아직도 배워야할 것이 많이 남았습니다.

고객을 찾는 것과 동등하게 중요한 것이 바로 고객의 문제점을 해결해줄 수 있는 제품을 만드는 것입니다. 이를 위해 많은 질문을 해봐야합니다. 고객이 어떻게 제품을 획득하는가? 제품이 고객의 문제점을 어떻게 해결해줄 것인가? 제품이 어떤 가치를 지니고 있나? 나만의 '비밀소스'는 무엇인가? 나는 경쟁상대에 비해 어디에 위치하나?

101에이어 기업가정신 102 강의 역시 다양한 분야의 기업가들의 사례연구를 심층분석합니다. 가상공간상의 영생(virtual immortality), 중소기업 마케팅, 도시 디자인, 언어 교육, 의료보건, 기업가 지원 서비스 등 여러 분야의 기업가들이 어떻게 제품 컨셉트를 개발하고, 고객의 문제점을 해결하며, 가치 제안을 정량화했는지, 또 어떻게 비밀소스를 개선하고, 경쟁자를 파악했는지 알아보겠습니다.

여정은 계속됩니다. 함께 하시겠습니까? 고객이 기다리고 있습니다.

                    <description>수업에 관하여 

많은 사람들이 훌륭한 아이디어와 기술을 가지고 있습니다. 하지만 "당신의 고객은 누구입니까?"라는 단순하지만 피해갈 수 없는 질문 하나로 갈피를 못 잡고 무너지곤 합니다. 

MIT공대는 수년간 이 질문을 기업가 학생들에게 던지면서 아주 성공적인 결과를 이루어냈습니다. MIT동문들이 세운 2만5천6백개의 기업들은 2조 달러 규모의 수익을 창출해냈으며 330만여개의 일자리를 만들어냈습니다. MIT가 국가였다면 세계에서 11번째로 큰 경제강국이 됐을 것입니다. 

여러분도 이 MIT 국가의 국민이 되어보세요. 여러분의 스타트업 여정을 MIT와 함께하시면서 성공의 핵심이 될 고객에 대해서 발견하는 시간을 가져보세요. 

이 강의는 기업가정신에 대한 수업으로  딱딱한 대학강의와는 거리가 멉니다. 매 수업시간마다 모바일 애플리케이션, 3D 프린팅, 전기전자, 국제개발, 손목시계 개발 등 다양한 분야의 MIT 출신 기업가들에 대한 심층적이고 전문적인 사례연구가 준비되어 있습니다. 

이러한 사례연구를 통해 여러분의 아이디어나 기술이 제품 단계로 넘어갔을 때 누가, 또 왜, 제품 구매의향을 가지게 되는지에 대한 공부를 할 것입니다. 과제물은 실제상황에 기반한 예제로 구성되어 있습니다. 구체적이고 실용적이며 효율적인 과정단계를 통해 예제를 풀면서, 이를 여러분 아이디어의 실체를 찾는 데 적용한다면 큰 도움이 될 것입니다. 

그럼 즐거운 수업 되시길 바랍니다!

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/mobile-application-experiences-mitx-21w-789x</link>
                    <description>How do you design a mobile app that truly changes people's lives? How can you understand how a new service is being used, both quantitatively and qualitatively? How can you use all of the rich sensing and I/O capabilities of mobile devices to create experiences that go far beyond what's possible on a traditional computer?

Mobile devices are changing the ways that we interact with each other and information in the world. This course will take you from a domain of interest, through generative research, design, usability, implementation and field evaluation of a novel mobile experience. You'll finish the course with a working, field-tested application suitable for release in the app store as well as a deep understanding of human interaction with mobile devices and services.

Based on a popular MIT class that has been taught since 2006 by Frank Bentley of Yahoo Labs and Ed Barrett, a Senior Lecturer at MIT, this course will explore what makes mobile devices unique. A primary focus will be on studying existing behavior and using key findings for design. While writing the code for an app is a part of the class, the majority of the topics will cover designing and evaluating a unique mobile experience. Along the way, you will have opportunities to share your work with other students from around the world! Java experience (or Objective C for iOS users) and a smartphone are required.

All required readings are available within the courseware, courtesy of The MIT Press. A print version of the course textbook, Building Mobile Experiences, is also available for purchase. The MIT Press is offering enrolled students a special 30% discount on books ordered directly through the publisher’s website. To take advantage of this offer, please use promotion code BME30 at The MIT Press site.</description>

                    <description>Do you like biology, biotechnology, or genetic engineering? Are you interested in computer science, engineering, or design? Synthetic Biology is an innovative field bringing together these subject areas and many more to create useful tools to solve everyday problems.

This introductory synthetic biology course starts with a brief overview of the field and then delves into more challenging yet exciting concepts. You will learn how to design your very own biological regulatory circuits and consider ways in which you can apply these circuits to real-world problems we face today.
From basic oscillators, toggle switches, and band-pass filters to more sophisticated circuits that build upon these devices, you will learn what synthetic biologists of today are currently constructing and how these circuits can be used in interesting and novel ways.

Join us as we explore the field of synthetic biology: its past, present, and promising future!</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/advanced-software-construction-java-mitx-6-005-2x</link>
                    <description>This computer science course is the second of a two-course sequence on how to write good software using modern software engineering techniques.

This course will dig deeper into what makes for "good" code -- safe from bugs, easy to understand, and ready for change. We will explore two paradigms for modern programming: (1) grammars, parsing, and recursive datatypes; and (2) concurrent programming with threads.

This is a challenging and rigorous course that will help you take the next step on your way to becoming a skilled software engineer.

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/computation-structures-3-computer-mitx-6-004-3x-0</link>
                    <description>Digital systems are at the heart of the information age in which we live, allowing us to store, communicate and manipulate information quickly and reliably. This computer science course is a bottom-up exploration of the abstractions, principles, and techniques used in the design of digital and computer systems. If you have a rudimentary knowledge of electricity and some exposure to programming, roll up your sleeves, join in and design a computer system!

This is Part 3 of a 3-part series on digital systems, providing an introduction to the hardware/software interface and is based on a course offered by the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Topics include pipelined computers, virtual memories, implementation of a simple time-sharing operating system, interrupts and real-time, and techniques for parallel processing.

Using your browser for design entry and simulation, you’ll optimize your processor design from Part 2 for size and speed, and make additions to a simple time-sharing operating system.

                    <title>Just Money: Banking as if Society Mattered</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/just-money-banking-if-society-mattered-mitx-11-405x-0</link>
                    <description>What do you know about banking? Do you know what your bank does with your money? The recent financial crisis highlighted some of the most fundamental issues with the mainstream banking system.

This course looks into banks that operate differently, namely, “just banks" that use capital and finance as a tool to address social and ecological challenges.

This course is for anyone who wants to understand the unique role banks play as intermediaries in our economy and how they can leverage that position to produce positive social, environmental, and economic change.

The instructors of this course have worked for over 10 years with just banks from around the world, as well as in the fields of community development, economic democracy, and social change.

No previous knowledge of finance or banking is needed to take this course.</description>

                    <title>Global Health Informatics to Improve Quality of Care</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/global-health-informatics-improve-mitx-hst-936x</link>
                    <description>Disease has no respect for country borders and increased global travel has fueled the spread of infectious disease, as evidenced by the Ebola virus epidemic. Chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, initially confined to the developed world, now exist side by side with malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Global warming is widening the endemicity of vector-borne diseases.

In this course, we will explore ways to leverage information technology to combat disease and promote health, especially in resource-constrained settings. Technology is a driving force that sweeps across nations even faster than disease and with the spread of mobile phones, which bring computational power and data to our fingertips, new paradigms in tracking and battling disease have been discovered.

This course will explore innovations in information systems in developing countries, and focus not only on the importance of technology, but also on broader issues necessary for its success, such as quality improvement, project management, and leadership skills. Ultimately, health care delivery systems require fundamental and sound operations, such as physical infrastructure and supply-chain management, to deliver high-quality care. Technology is simply a tool to help facilitate this process.

The quality of care theme is critical to this course. The first step stakeholders in health systems should focus on prior to introducing an innovation is to establish a culture of quality improvement and patient safety. An information system can then play a facilitative role by enabling care coordination, tracking processes and outcomes, informing decision making, and fostering learning through data analysis.

An information system without an accompanying organizational transformation risks reinforcing the same failed processes. Using technology to improve access to care without any other quality improvement elements will yield the same and not necessarily better results, but more of them. Innovations need to address gaps in quality and demonstrate improvement in health outcomes, otherwise they won’t sustain or scale.

Lastly, we will discuss our attempts to leverage troves of data to define best practice and how we must keep the patient perspective and health at the center of everything we do.

This course is targeted toward individuals interested in designing or implementing a health information and communication technology (ICT) solution in the developing world. Implementing a health information technology project requires multidisciplinary teams. Thus, with this course, we hope to bring together individuals from a variety of disciplines—computer science, medicine, engineering, public health, policy, and business.</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-differential-equations-mitx-18-031x</link>
                    <description>How do you design:

A boat that doesn’t tip over as it bobs in the water?
	The suspension system of a car for a smooth ride?
	Circuits that tune to the correct frequencies in a cell phone?
How do you model:

The growth of antibiotic resistant bacteria?
	Gene expression?
	Online purchasing trends?
The answer: Differential Equations.

Differential equations are the language of the models we use to describe the world around us. In this mathematics course, we will explore temperature, spring systems, circuits, population growth, and biological cell motion to illustrate how differential equations can be used to model nearly everything in the world around us.

We will develop the mathematical tools needed to solve linear differential equations. In the case of nonlinear differential equations, we will employ graphical methods and approximation to understand solutions.

                    <title>Introduction to Probability - The Science of Uncertainty</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-probability-science-mitx-6-041x-2</link>
                    <description>The world is full of uncertainty: accidents, storms, unruly financial markets, noisy communications. The world is also full of data. Probabilistic modeling and the related field of statistical inference are the keys to analyzing data and making scientifically sound predictions.

Probabilistic models use the language of mathematics. But instead of relying on the traditional "theorem - proof" format, we develop the material in an intuitive -- but still rigorous and mathematically precise -- manner. Furthermore, while the applications are multiple and evident, we emphasize the basic concepts and methodologies that are universally applicable.

The course covers all of the basic probability concepts, including:

multiple discrete or continuous random variables, expectations, and conditional distributions
	laws of large numbers
	the main tools of Bayesian inference methods
	an introduction to random processes (Poisson processes and Markov chains)
The contents of this course are essentially the same as those of the corresponding MIT class (Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability) -- a course that has been offered and continuously refined over more than 50 years. It is a challenging class, but it will enable you to apply the tools of probability theory to real-world applications or your research.</description>

                    <description>In this engineering course, we will explore the processing and structure of cellular solids as they are created from polymers, metals, ceramics, glasses and composites.  We will derive models for the mechanical properties of honeycombs and foams, and we will discover how the unique properties of these materials can be exploited in applications such as lightweight structural panels, energy absorption devices, and thermal insulation.

The Cellular Solids: Structures, Properties and Engineering Applications course provides a general understanding of cellular solids. Following this module, learners will be prepared to take one or both add-on modules to learn more about applications in medicine and to cellular materials in nature:

Cellular Solids 2:  Applications in Medicine
	Cellular Solids 3: Applications in Nature
Taken together, these three modules provide similar content to the MIT subject 3.054: Cellular Solids: Structure, Properties, and Applications.</description>

                    <description>To be effective, educational technologies must be designed based on what we know about how people learn. Through interviews with experts in the field, this course explores educational technologies, outlines the theories that influence their development, and examines their use.

Participants will both give and receive feedback from others in the class forums as part of this course. To synthesize main ideas, participants will work towards creating a pitch for a new educational technology.

In Unit 1, we will talk about the history of educational technologies and how these technologies have influenced how we learn.

In Unit 2, we will explore what it means to learn something and different approaches to deepen learning.

In Unit 3, we will focus on active learning and take a closer look at simulations that can foster learning.

Unit 4 introduces the idea of collaborative learning and considers communities of practice.

Unit 5 provides an overview of different types of assessment and delves into how technology is changing the field of assessment.

Unit 6 is all about design-based research, a methodology for research and design of educational innovations.</description>

                    <title>The Iterative Innovation Process</title>
                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/iterative-innovation-process-mitx-3-086x</link>
                    <description>3.086x: The Iterative Innovation Process draws heavily upon the course material used in 3.086x: Innovation and Commercialization. Though there have been significant changes to the course, this course is not an entirely new edX offering.

People innovate, not organizations. This course is for anybody who wants to understand the innovation process - whether you want to foster innovation within your organization or whether you want to personally innovate.

As practicing innovators, we teach you the fundamentals of how to think like an innovator. Innovation is an iterative process, not a linear one. When innovating, there are thousands of sources of uncertainty in Technology, Implementation, and Markets. We teach you how to cycle through these sources of uncertainty until the right pieces come together in an innovation.

Throughout the course, we build up the innovation process model step by step with real examples and exercises. The goal of this course is to change and refine the way you view the innovation process, providing you with the foundation on which to build your future innovation</description>

                    <link>https://www.edx.org/course/computational-probability-inference-mitx-6-008-1x</link>
                    <description>Probability and inference are used everywhere. For example, they help us figure out which of your emails are spam, what results to show you when you search on Google, how a self-driving car should navigate its environment, or even how a computer can beat the best Jeopardy and Go players! What do all of these examples have in common? They are all situations in which a computer program can carry out inferences in the face of uncertainty at a speed and accuracy that far exceed what we could do in our heads or on a piece of paper.

In this data analysis and computer programming course, you will learn the principles of probability and inference. We will put these mathematical concepts to work in code that solves problems people care about. You will learn about different data structures for storing probability distributions, such as probabilistic graphical models, and build efficient algorithms for reasoning with these data structures.

By the end of this course, you will know how to model real-world problems with probability, and how to use the resulting models for inference.

You don’t need to have prior experience in either probability or inference, but you should be comfortable with basic Python programming and calculus.
